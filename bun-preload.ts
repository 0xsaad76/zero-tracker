/**
 * Preload for `bun test` (see bunfig.toml). Bun does not hoist jest.mock and

 * modules must be mocked BEFORE any test file imports them.
 *
 * jest (`bun run test`) remains the canonical runner — it covers the full
 * suite including the App render smoke test, which bun cannot parse. The
 * pure suites (planner, upgrader, sanitize, numberUtils, expenseService)
 * run under both.
